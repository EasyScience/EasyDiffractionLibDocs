# Making diffraction data analysis easy

**EasyDiffraction** is a scientific software for the calculation of neutron powder diffraction pattern based on a structural model and refinement of its parameters against experimental data.

**EasyDiffraction** is distributed both as a cross-platform desktop application and as a **Python** library.

Here you can find how to use the **EasyDiffraction** python library. The **EasyDiffraction** graphical user interface documentation can be found [elsewhere](https://docs.easydiffraction.org/app).
