Here, a collection of notebooks regarding refinement of a few simple parameters for neutron powder diffraction data for PbSO4 is shown.
The results from least-squares, bumps-dream, and emcee will be compared and discussed.

Note here that in order to obtain converged results from bumps-dream and emcee one requires rather long MCMC simulations.
